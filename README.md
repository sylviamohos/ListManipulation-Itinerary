# ListManipulation-Itinerary
Demonstrate List manipulation by implementing methods to make changes to an itinerary.

### Situation

Typically, when we take a multi-city trip we need a travel itinerary. In
this activity we will implement an `Itinerary` class that will enable us
to perform useful operations like adding or removing a destination. The
`Destination` class contains information on the location and days that will 
be spent in the given location.

### Task

Implement 6 methods in the `Itinerary` class to demonstrate List manipulation:

- `addDestination(Destination destination)`
- `getDestination(int position)`
- `removeDestination(int position)`
- `getListOfLocations()`
- `getTotalNumberOfDays()`
- `getNumberOfDestinations()`
